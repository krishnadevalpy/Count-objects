Counting objects in an image is a task of computer vision. There are many computer vision libraries that you can use for this task, such as OpenCV, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-image, and cvlib. You must have not heard much about the cvlib library in Python. Well, this is a very simple, high level, and easy to use computer vision library in Python.

By using the features of this library we can count the number of objects in an image using Python. To use this library, make sure you have OpenCV and TensorFlow installed in your systems. You can easily install it by using the pip command; pip install cvlib
